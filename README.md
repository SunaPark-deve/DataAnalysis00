# Project : COVID-19 Face Mask Detector

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Face Mask Detection system built with OpenCV, Keras/TensorFlow using Deep Learning in order to detect face masks in static images and videos as well as in real-time video streams

Motivation
The COVID-19 mask detector weâ€™re building here today could potentially be used to help ensure your safety and the safety of others.
